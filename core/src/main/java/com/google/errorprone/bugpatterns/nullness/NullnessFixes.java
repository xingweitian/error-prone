     * - Look for imports of other annotations that are part of an artifact that also contains
     *   @Nullable (e.g., javax.annotation.Nonnull).
     *
     * - Call getSymbolFromString. (But that may return transitive dependencies that will cause

     *
     * - Among available candidates, prefer type-usage annotations.
     *
     * - When we suggest a jsr305 annotation, might we want to suggest @CheckForNull over @Nullable?
     *   It's more verbose, but it's more obviously a declaration annotation, and it's the
     *   annotation that is *technically* defined to produce the behaviors that users want.
     *
     * TODO(cpovirk): This code will probably already use type annotations if they are imported, but
     * it probably isn't always putting them in the right place for arrays and nested types.
